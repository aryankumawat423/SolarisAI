# **App Name**: SolarisAI

## Core Features:

- Solar Panel Damage Detection: Upload an image of your solar panel, and the AI tool will identify any damage (cracks, dust, discoloration) and suggest appropriate actions (clean, repair, replace).
- Energy Loss Prediction: Predict the percentage of energy loss due to dirt and damage using AI regression models. Display the trends in an interactive chart.
- Solar Panel Position Optimization: Use NASA solar data and your location to calculate the optimal tilt angle for your solar panel, maximizing energy gain.
- Dashboard: Display a dashboard with image upload, AI detection results, energy loss graph, position optimization form, AR placement preview and VR simulation trigger.
- AI Chatbot Support: Integrate a floating chatbot widget for instant support and FAQs related to solar panel maintenance and performance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Bright yellow (#FFC107) for a solar-inspired theme.
- Secondary colors: Deep blue (#1976D2) and vibrant green (#4CAF50) to complement the yellow.
- Accent: Orange (#FFB300) for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Use glassmorphism effects for cards and panels to give a futuristic, eco-friendly feel.
- Incorporate subtle animations using Framer Motion for smooth transitions and hover effects.
- Employ a set of consistent, modern icons related to solar energy and AI.

## Original User Request:
Create a fully functional, stunning, and colorful modern web application for an AI-powered solar panel optimization platform using React.js for the frontend and FastAPI with MongoDB for the backend. The website should be highly interactive, visually appealing, and responsive, with a vibrant color palette featuring solar-inspired hues like bright yellows (#FFC107), deep blues (#1976D2), vibrant greens (#4CAF50), and gradient backgrounds. Use Tailwind CSS for styling, Framer Motion for smooth animations, and incorporate glassmorphism and 3D effects to give it a futuristic, eco-friendly vibe. Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness.

Frontend Design & Tech Stack Suggestions:
Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion + Chart.js + React-Chatbot + React-Toastify.
Animations: LottieFiles for hero animations, GSAP for scroll effects.
AR/VR: WebXR for AR, Three.js for 3D elements.
Fonts: Poppins or Roboto (bold and colorful sans-serif).
Color Palette: Bright yellow (#FFC107), deep blue (#1976D2), vibrant green (#4CAF50), with gradient backgrounds.
Design Style: Futuristic + Eco-friendly + Playful (glass UI, 3D cards, vibrant gradients, clean spacing).
Frontend Functionality Integration:
Connect to the backend API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/:
Image Upload: Use axios to POST to /upload-image with FormData, display response (damage_type, energy_loss, action).
Position Optimization: POST to /optimize-position with latitude/longitude/tilt, show recommended_tilt and energy_gain.
AR Placement: Fetch placement data and render with WebXR/Three.js.
VR Simulation: Trigger VR mode with preloaded data.
Handle errors with colorful toast notifications (React-Toastify).
Ensure real-time updates with state management (Context API or Redux).
Backend Development
Build a fully functional FastAPI backend with MongoDB, including all APIs to support the frontend features. The backend should be structured as follows:



Database Setup (database.py):
Use MongoDB connection with environment variables.


API Endpoints (api/v1/endpoints.py):
/upload-image: Handle image uploads, detect damage, and store results.
/optimize-position: Process position data and return optimization results.
/ar-vr-simulation: Provide simulation data for AR/VR.
Main App (main.py):
Configure FastAPI with CORS for frontend integration.
Setup Instructions:
Create uploads/ directory in solar-backend/.
Run pip install -r requirements.txt after generating requirements.txt with the listed dependencies.
Start MongoDB and the FastAPI server with uvicorn app.main:app --reload.
Final Result:
The project should be a fully working application with a vibrant, engaging frontend and a robust backend. The website should blend a high-tech solar dashboard with a playful eco-app aesthetic, optimized for performance, and include a "Get Started" modal on load with a colorful welcome animation. Provide the complete React code (including components, styles, and API integration) and the full backend code, ready to run with npm start for the frontend and the FastAPI command for the backend.
